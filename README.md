# 🛠️ Landing Pages and Webpage Generator with AI

**Landing Pages and Webpage Generator with AI** is a project developed during a hackathon. It leverages the power of AI to streamline the process of creating and editing landing pages and websites. Users can interact with a chatbot to generate custom webpages based on specific requirements and refine them through conversational prompts.

## ✨ Features

- **AI-Powered Webpage Generation**: 
  - Effortlessly generate fully functional landing pages and websites tailored to your needs.
- **Interactive Editing**: 
  - Modify and customize generated webpages by interacting with the chatbot in real-time.
- **Export and Deploy**: 
  - Seamlessly export the final code and deploy your webpage directly to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) with a single click.

## 💡 How It Works

1. **Chatbot Interaction**: Start a conversation with the chatbot to describe your website's goals, preferences, and styles.
2. **Webpage Generation**: The AI processes your input and generates the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code needed for your website.
3. **Editing**: Further refine the webpage by providing additional prompts, such as changing colors, adding sections, or modifying text.
4. **Export and Deploy**: Once satisfied, export the code and deploy it instantly to Netlify.
